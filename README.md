# Air Pollution
Collaborated in a team to develop an innovative machine learning solution for predicting air pollution levels.
Designed and implemented a machine learning model utilizing techniques such as Random Forest Regression, Linear Regression to accurately forecast air pollution levels based on relevant data inputs.
Conducted thorough preprocessing of the input data, including cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering, to enhance the model's performance and minimize potential biases.
Evaluated the model's predictive capabilities using various metrics, ensuring robustness and reliability in the predictions.
Employed data visualization techniques to effectively present the model's outputs and provide insights to team members and stakeholders.
Developed a user-friendly frontend interface using Gradio and Tkinter, allowing easy navigation and interaction with the model for users.
